# Introduction 
In this project we created a token for the Degen gaming company called as 'Degen'(DGN), we have used the solidity programming language to create the token and we deployed it to the Avalanche C-Chain fuji network using hardhat . 

## Description

In this project we created a DGN token that the players will get and they can  redeem the tokens for exiting prizes that are currently listed. We have used the hardhat and others things following up solidity programming language and to interact with it we used the https://remix.ethereum.org editor .

This project was the final project for the intermediate course in the metacrafters platform. We were asked to create a token for the company 

* Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
* Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
* Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
* Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
* Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed

## Getting Started
* Clone the repo
* create a .env file
```
  WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY = 0x000000000000 
  SNOWTRACE_API_KEY = 1234567890asdfgjklfukuds
```
* Enter your keys and save the .env file.
Remember to test your smart contract you will need dummy avax that you will easily get from https://faucet.avax.network/.
* Then open metamask and add a network.

  Network Name: Avalanche Fuji C-Chain New RPC URL: https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc ChainID: 43113 Symbol: AVAX Explorer: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/

There is a quick way to connect to the Fuji (C-Chain), Below the main modal in the faucet, you'll see a ðŸ¦Š Add Subnet to Metamask button. If you press it, it will automate the process of adding the network to your wallet.

```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network fuji
Points token deployed to <YOUR TOKEN ADDRESS>

```
* Copy <YOUR TOKEN ADDRESS> and paste in https://testnet.snowtrace.io/
* Open remix editor and copy past the DegenToken.sol file and click on compile.
